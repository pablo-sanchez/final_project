Notion,"Data Scientist, Growth","New York, NY","About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
About The Role:
Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. The Growth Data Science team aims at accelerating product growth at every step of the user journey to ensure you get the best value out of Notion. As an early member of the growth data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together and then doing the hands-on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring where we see the biggest opportunity to improve user experience, what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering and ideally with growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You are comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.
Nice to Haves:
You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
You have been a Technical Lead or Manager within Data Science teams previously
You have helped design processes that data science teams use to collaborate with their product and engineering peers.
You have a track record of acting as a thought partner to product or engineering leaders, driving strategic decisions on these teams using data.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Ntropy Network,Data Scientist,Remote,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

WHAT WE DO

Axiom Data Science, a Tetra Tech Company, is a fast-moving and dynamic technology and informatics company with a mission to build a better understanding of society and the environment by increasing the accessibility, reuse, and impact of scientific data. To that end, we provide cyberinfrastructure support, data management systems, and scalable technical solutions for organizing and analyzing large amounts of diverse datasets to organizations across the globe. We’ve assembled an outstanding team of software and data engineers, data analysts, project managers, and data coordinators to tackle difficult problems and provide excellent support to our partners at businesses, non-profits, federal and state agencies, and universities.

We offer a flexible, collaborative working environment, and we have a company culture that promotes taking initiative, solving problems, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We want to do great work, while being a great place to work. We are headquartered in Anchorage, AK and have satellite offices in Portland, OR; and North Kingstown, RI. Work location for this position is flexible and may be remote, though we would prefer someone in close proximity to one of our offices. Approximately ? of Axiom currently works remotely.

Our work matters: if you want to make a difference in oceanography, climate science, or scientific data management, this is the place to do it. We work hard on interesting problems and push the boundaries of science and computing.


HOW WE WORK

We are a software-services company forming mutually beneficial partnerships with partners. We believe in focusing time and energy on our core products, and encouraging staff to take ownership of their work.

We are a geographically distributed company and collaborate with each other online. Strong communication skills are critical. We work together closely while minimizing distractions.

We have low administrative overhead. Staff are given all the tools they need to excel and are self-driven, resourceful, and instrumental in expanding our vision.


WHAT YOU WILL DO

Though the Axiom team works with scientific data, research is not our primary focus. Instead, we build visualization and analysis capabilities that make new insights possible, and work with our partners and stakeholders to build operational products on top of their data sets. Along the way, we adhere to open science standards by improving metadata and semantically linking datasets - transforming scientists’ research results into meaningful products that reach far beyond the initial intent.

As a data engineer, you’ll be part of this process. You will contribute to and advance our suite of scientific data management tools, techniques, and services. This requires looking beyond a single project, discipline or research interest. And it also demands teamwork and an ever broadening suite of individual skills. On a daily basis, you might:

Develop routines for extracting, transforming, manipulating, formatting, compiling, and curating large and complex geophysical and scientific data primarily from the coastal and ocean domains;
Develop and contribute to the existing data services that Axiom has built to handle large-scale scientific datasets;
Work with data librarians to translate scientific data, metadata, and analytic results into end-user products and APIs;
Prototype analysis code in Jupyter and migrate the code into our team’s operational data processing pipeline.


WHAT WE LOOK FOR

As a company taking on complex information and data science challenges, Axiom depends on all employees being multi-talented, imaginative, and resourceful. Staff are provided with the tools they need to perform at their highest level and rewarded with an employee-focused work environment. Data science exists at the intersection of three domains: computer science, mathematics and statistics, and scientific expertise. We are seeking a candidate who can contribute to each of these domains through prior experience handling and analyzing marine, atmospheric or geospatial data. Experience with community standard open-source tools and scientific data formats is important, but inspiration, vision, motivation, determination, and commitment are the qualities Axiom values most.

We are looking for a demonstrated history of working with real-world data, and that you have some of the following skills and experiences:

4+ years of relevant experience with a spectrum of environmental scientific data formats;
Experience programming with the core Python data science stack;
Experience with machine learning concepts, techniques, and frameworks;
Experience with the core concepts of software engineering (e.g. source control, continuous integration tools, unit testing and coding best practices);
Experience building and/or working with services and APIs on top of large scientific and/or geospatial datasets;
Experience with core geospatial concepts such as raster, vectors, projections and spatial operations as well as familiarity with open-standards based GIS tooling and storage formats (e.g., GeoTIFF, GeoDatabase, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, GeoJSON);
Willingness to dive in and embrace other aspects of our data processing stack: Linux, Docker, Jupyter, Spark, GeoServer, Dask, Ray, TimescaleDB, Parquet/Arrow
Self-motivation, independence, flexibility, and a problem-solving attitude

Degree / Certifications
Degree in computer science, statistics, mathematics, or similar quantitative discipline; or a degree in the physical and/or environmental sciences (oceanography, meteorology, etc.) with quantitative and programming experience.


Work Environment

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea.

The Trade Desk,Data Scientist I,"New York, NY","The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
ABOUT THE ROLE
Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners and, as such, you will have the opportunity to participate in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
You have an abundance of curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning and developing new skills.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You have broad familiarity with basic concepts in probability and statistics, along with exposure to basic foundations of computer science.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 0 to 5 years or a PhD with 0 to 2 years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
ABOUT THE ROLE
Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners and, as such, you will have the opportunity to participate in most aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
You have an abundance of curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning and developing new skills.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You have broad familiarity with basic concepts in probability and statistics, along with exposure to basic foundations of computer science.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 0 to 5 years or a PhD with 0 to 2 years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment. Please contact us to request accommodation.

Ntropy Networ,Data Scientist,"New York, NY","Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

About Wambi:
Founder, Alexandra Coren created Wambi out of an unyielding need to bring human connection back to the center of patient care. Both personally and professionally, Alex spent time immersed in hospital settings, where care providers were rarely appreciated. It became apparent that this was leading to high burnout rates, and strongly affecting the quality of their care. To address this Alex leveraged technology to recognize and reward care providers in real-time with feedback obtained directly through the eyes of patients and their families. With her passion for technology, and commitment to compassion, Alex has been able to grow Wambi into the thriving startup that it is today.
Founded in 2016, Wambi, delivers a patient-driven healthcare employee performance and reward platform aimed at recognizing and empowering compassionate care. Through its gamified digital platform informed by real-time patient feedback, care providers are armed with their individual data as a means to promote autonomy and inspire behavioral change. Visit us at www.wambi.org.
Wambi is about human connections. We are new and fresh, and we believe fun in the workplace is essential. We are not bogged down by the ways things were done in the past, but rather are motivated to co-create a new normal. We are the nexus where tech, gratitude and human kindness meet. We are driven by a collective vision for a more compassionate and connected society. We believe in the power of moments and of humans being able to rise above all odds and achieve super human heights. We view feedback as the fuel for interpersonal growth and are always striving to achieve the highest versions of ourselves and to lift others up along the way. Our five values are the essence of who we are:

About Crumbl Cookies
Crumbl began as a small cookie shop in the small town of Logan, Utah. It started with one big dream, two crazy cousins, and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips. Crumbl was established in 2017 in Logan, Utah by Jason McGowan and Sawyer Hemsley. After thousands of dollars in wasted dough, recipes that did not live up to their expectations, and cookies that were just plain embarrassing to them today, Crumbl has over 600 locations across the United States and is growing everyday!

Modern Intelligenc,Machine Learning Research Assistant,"Austin, TX","Modern Intelligence is seeking exceptional students to join the team as a Machine Learning Research Assistant, and contribute to the creation of classical and hierarchical neural networks for American defense, in areas including sensor fusion, decision making, autonomy, complex inference, electronic warfare, and more. This position is the candidate’s choice of half-time or full-time. Interested candidates with a PhD are encouraged to apply to our AI Research Scientist Internship position. This position is full time and open to remote candidates.


About Modern’s Research:
Modern Intelligence is an Artificial Intelligence product and R&D company. Our product line is defense-first, and tackles some of the hardest and most interesting problems of the decade in machine learning, with a current focus on multi-modal domain awareness and complex scene understanding. And our research program focuses on foundational improvements to machine learning that aim to close the performance gap between artificial and biological neural networks. Whereas the current trend in machine learning is towards more data, more GPUs, and models with trillions of parameters, the fruit fly brain needs less than 200,000 neurons to achieve vision, target identification, navigation, and obstacle avoidance that is orders of magnitude more robust than any artificial neural network.

The brittleness and inefficiency of artificial neural networks likely comes from a combination of
artificial neurons having “less compute”,
artificial neural architectures produced by NAS and human engineers having suboptimal topologies, and
SGD and other training processes being highly inefficient

relative to their biological equivalents. Modern’s research program uses proprietary advances in information theory to train hierarchical neural networks, or HNNs, with modular intermediate levels of structure that address the problem of multiscale competence. (See a recent interview with Dr. Michael Levin [video][transcript] to learn more about the high-level biological insights that motivate multiscale competence as a desirable [and possibly necessary] factor for robustness and efficient learning of high-complexity problems.)

About the position:
Pay: $7,000 / month for full-time

We’re looking for a curious and insightful student who believes that the answer isn’t just more data, and who has a deep appreciation of the benefits of sparsity, hierarchy, efficiency, and taking the right lessons from biology. With your team at Modern, you’ll get hands-on experience with some of the hardest problems in ML from both the product and the research direction. You’ll help build Modern’s research community, and will contribute directly to a research program that creates and trains HNNs in order to address the multiscale competence problem, work towards natural robustness in neural networks, and create general re-usable neural modules that can be leveraged in future learning. You’ll have as much guidance as you need and as much project ownership as you want, including the opportunity and encouragement to propose, design, and run your own experiments, and to publish the results.
Basic Qualifications:
Recent PhD or active enrollment in a PhD program in Computer Science, Data Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, or related field. Undergraduates and masters students will be considered if their application is sufficiently strong.

GRI,Machine Learning Engineer,Remote,"About Us
We’re on a mission to crush technical debt.
We believe that a big challenge in the next decade will be crumbling digital infrastructure. Our entire modern economy runs on code, but we haven’t developed appropriate tools to ensure software remains reliable over time.
Companies know that technical debt threatens the reliability of their services and slows down the pace of innovation, but struggle to find enough engineering talent to fix issues—most software maintenance today is still done manually and delayed as long as possible.
We believe there is a better way. By combining the best of static analysis and machine learning, we are building the infrastructure for self-maintaining software. Our work involves solving challenging technical problems across program analysis, distributed systems, and machine learning.
We’re funded by top investors (Founders Fund, Abstract Ventures, 8VC) and have launched a private alpha with significant ARR.
About the role
As our first machine learning hire, you will be responsible for building our foundational ML infrastructure and experimenting with novel techniques to deliver product value through deep learning. You’ll experiment with fine-tuning existing models and building custom models to solve problems like automatic type inference, code similarity analysis, and program synthesis.
This role is ideal for tinkerers and researchers who want to see their insights transformed into real products. You will have significant ownership over our product roadmap and autonomy to design experiments from scratch.
Responsibilities
Research potential approaches to deploy machine learning for solving concrete business problems.
Define strategies to build ML infrastructure for model development (training, validation, tuning) and model serving.
Transform words into product: understand concepts in research papers and revamp research code to build production-grade ML code to power magical experiences in our product.
Qualifications
4+ years of software engineering experience with at least 2 years of applied machine learning experience
Execution-driven mindset: you love shipping.
Comfortable working on low-structure environments and navigating unknown unknowns.
Excellent communication, writing and presentation skills.
Why you should join us
Build a meaningful product to solve a tangible problem for companies.
Ownership in all senses of the word: significant equity upside, direct impact on product vision, and contact with users.
Solve your own problems. We dogfood our own product and you can build the ideal developer experience as you work.
You’ll learn new techniques on the cutting edge of research in programming languages and machine learning.
Work with a talented team from Google and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
We’re well-funded and offer a competitive base salary up to $250k.
Location Policy
We believe that talent is widely distributed, but that the most impactful work is done through high bandwidth in-person collaboration. Candidates from anywhere in the Americas are welcome to apply, but we hope to work with you regularly in person. We’re happy to travel to you, or can sponsor you to join us in NYC or San Francisco either permanently or temporarily.
Relocation is not required—don’t let your location stop you from applying.

The Lab is primarily supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science. Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA) operates and manages the Laboratory for DOE.
Organizational Overview

The mission of the NSLS-II’s Photon Science Division is to enable world-class research by delivering exceptional scientific tools to a broad user community that requires large scale facilities. Enhanced data analysis for x-ray scattering data, independent of the scientific sample, is essential to this mission. To that effect, the Coherent Soft X-ray (CSX) and Coherent Hard X-ray (CHX) beamlines at NSLS-II are partnering with the Brookhaven National Laboratory Computer Science Initiative (CSI) in order to test existing or develop new machine learning algorithms to that reduce the required expertise in data reduction and analysis. X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS), which utilizes a time series of x-ray scattering patterns from a given sample, will be the focus of this effort.
Position Description

Work closely with CSI and NSLS-II scientists to develop machine learning algorithms that can distinguish between “good” time series data sets and those containing systematic error, quantify systematic error effects in order to salvage data, and to use machine learning to extract physically meaningful quantities from large data sets. Such capabilities will be applicable to equilibrium and non-equilibrium scientific samples probed by x-rays, allow external researchers to spend more time understanding results and planning experiments, and reduce the required expertise and knowledge to perform these experiments. For reference, see some of our publicly available work Scientific Reports 11.1 (2021): 1-12 and arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.07889 (2022) – accepted to Physical Review Research. We have further unpublished models supporting various capabilities.
Essential Duties and Responsibilities:
Develop machine learning and AI methods for coherent scattering time series data sets (e.g., XPCS) with the end goal of reliably and accurately quantifying observed timescales of sample dynamics regardless of the data quality.
Develop machine learning and AI methods that can integrate with NSLS-II’s data pipeline (beamline servers and dedicated HPC-like resources).
Collaborate with a wide variety of researchers that include experimental scientists, mathematicians and theorists, data scientists and engineers, and computational scientists in order to complete project deliverables.
Present and publish results.
Position Requirements

From pets to parenting, there's a community for everybody on Reddit and with over 50 million daily active users, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. For more information, visit redditinc.com.
We are looking for a manager to be a part of the Ads Data Science team and lead a small group of machine learning and analytics data scientists. You will work closely with engineering managers, engineers and product owners from our Ads team to optimize ads delivery and auction systems. In addition to strong ML skills, this person has a solid business acumen and understands what is important to advertisers.
Responsibilities:
You will start off with leading a team of 4-5 data scientists with some specializing in Machine Learning and others in analytics. The expectation is to scale the team to ~10 in 2023.
You will build optimization algorithms that improve ad yields and efficiencies. Our optimization models were hugely successful in the last 12 months and as a result we are increasing our investment in this area.
Along with building ML models, you will be a key strategic player in defining the roadmap for the ML efforts for the entire Ads Org. Your roadmap will not only achieve immediate business goals, but also dictate our long term strategy for optimization and marketplace efforts.
Manage and nurture a team of talented Data Scientists and have a keen interest in shaping their careers.
Some of the models we developed over the last year are CPC (cost per click), CPI (cost per install), Generalized pCVR (probability of conversion rate), ALO (Ad Level Optimization) and User Lookalikes.
